## ✨About
Requiem provides gamers from different countries, cultures, and age groups with a safe environment that allows them to interact with and expand their social circles. We strive to improve their quality of life with free added value in the form of content, events, and giveaways.

<!-- ## 🗝 Key values
**Inclusivity**  
We want our community to be a home for everyone. Everyone is welcome regardless of culture, ethnicity, nationality, health status, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation or religious beliefs. We accept anyone who shows respect to others in our community.

**Accessibility**  
We want everyone to be able to experience our community and everything we have to offer. No one in our community should be limited by mental or physical disabilities. We aim to provide a user-friendly platform for our members. Therefore, we will always support those that need help.

**Integrity**  
We want our members to genuinely trust in our brand. Because of that, we are honest and transparent about what we do and why we do it.

**Positivity**  
We want to create a safe and positive environment for all of our members. An environment that takes away the worry of real life situations and minimizes the toxicity one might find in the gaming scene.

**Excitement**  
We want to stand out from the crowd and get people excited about our community. We do not want to be seen as just another gaming community. Instead, we strive to be one’s favorite source of entertainment.
